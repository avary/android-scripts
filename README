Defaults
--------
For these scripts to work, the following need to be taken into consideration
especially with the memory requirements, otherwise the scripts to compile
CM7 and CM9 will not work

OS: ubuntu 10.04, Debian 6
Memory: CM7 >= 6G, CM9 >= 15G

1. /data/android/git -- All git repos and CM syncs
2. /data/android/leo/CM -- Base compilation of CM7
3. /data/android/leo/CM-ics -- Base compilation of CM9
4. /data/android/recovery -- Base directory for compilation of CWM recovery
